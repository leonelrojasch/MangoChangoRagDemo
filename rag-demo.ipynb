      "Chunk Content: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)### Definition RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a method that integrates external data into a Large Language Model prompt to generate relevant responses. This approach is particularly beneficial when using a large corpus of unstructured text based on different topics. It allows for answers to be grounded in the organization’s knowledge base (KB), providing a more tailored and accurate response.RAG is also advantageous when answering questions based on an organization’s private data or when the public data that the model was trained on might have become outdated. This helps ensure that the responses are always up-to-date and relevant, regardless of the changes in the data landscape.### Illustrative use caseA corporate HR department is looking to provide an intelligent assistant that answers specific employee health insurance related questions such as \"are eyeglasses covered?\" RAG is used to ingest the extensive and numerous documents associated with insurance plan policies to enable the answering of these specific types of questions.### Things to consider- RAG helps ground AI output in real-world data and reduces the likelihood of fabrication.- RAG is helpful when there is a need to answer questions based on private proprietary data.- RAG is helpful when you might want questions answered that are recent (for example, before the cutoff date of when the model version was last trained).### Getting started- Retrieval Augmented Generation in Azure AI Studio - Azure AI Studio | Microsoft Learn- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in Azure AI Search- Retrieval Augmented Generation using Azure Machine Learning prompt flow (preview)\n",

A best practice is to complete an initial round of manual red teaming before conducting systematic measurements and implementing mitigations. As highlighted above, the goal of RAI red teaming is to identify harms, understand the risk surface, and develop the list of harms that can inform what needs to be measured and mitigated.Here is how you can get started and plan your process of red teaming LLMs. Advance planning is critical to a productive red teaming exercise.\\nWhy is RAI red teaming an important practice?\\n11/03/2023\\nLearn about how red teaming and adversarial testing are an essential practice in the responsible development of systems and features using large language models (LLMs)\\nPlanning red teaming for large language models (LLMs) and their applications \",\n",

This approach is used when the model needs to learn and generalize over specific topics, particularly when these topics are generally small in scope.Fine-tuning requires the use of high-quality training data, in a special example based format, to create the new fine-tuned Large Language Model. By focusing on specific topics, fine-tuning allows the model to provide more accurate and relevant responses within those areas of focus.### Illustrative use caseAn IT department has been using GPT-4 to convert natural language queries to SQL, but they have found that the responses are not always reliably grounded in their schema, and the cost is prohibitively high.They fine-tune GPT-3.5-Turbo with hundreds of requests and correct responses and produce a model that performs better than the base model with lower costs and latency.### Things to consider- Fine-tuning is an advanced capability; it enhances LLM with after-cutoff-date knowledge and/or domain specific knowledge. Start by evaluating the baseline performance of a standard model against their requirements before considering this option.- Having a baseline for performance without fine-tuning is essential for knowing whether fine-tuning has improved model performance. Fine-tuning with bad data makes the base model worse, but without a baseline, it's hard to detect regressions.- Good cases for fine-tuning include steering the model to output content in a specific and customized style, tone, or format, or tasks where the information needed to steer the model is too long or complex to fit into the prompt window.- Fine-tuning costs:  - Fine-tuning can reduce costs across two dimensions: (1) by using fewer tokens depending on the task (2) by using a smaller model (for example GPT 3.5 Turbo can potentially be fine-tuned to achieve the same quality of GPT-4 on a particular task).  - Fine-tuning has upfront costs for training the model. And additional hourly costs for hosting the custom model once it's deployed.### Getting started- When to use Azure OpenAI fine-tuning- Customize a model with fine-tuning- Azure OpenAI GPT 3.5 Turbo fine-tuning tutorial- To fine-tune or not to fine-tune?
